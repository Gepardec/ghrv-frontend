  <h1>General</h1>
  <p>This application is used to determine the unique/total views to the public <a
    href="https://www.github.com/gepardec"
    target="_blank">GitHub
    repos</a> of <a href="https://www.gepardec.com" target="_blank">gepardec</a>.</p>

  <h1>User interface</h1>
  <p>The UI is split into two parts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sidebar</li>
    <li>Chart</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sidebar</h3>
  <p>Here you can set preferences like date range, repos to display, best repos (by total/unique views), et al.</p>
  <p>Note the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The value inside best repos will always override the repo selection when refreshing the page.</li>
    <li>The definition of "best" is calculated via the current view mode. If you select total views then the best n
      repos with the highest total views are displayed. For unique views this works vice versa.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chart</h3>
  <p>This part displays the data corresponding to the preferences in the sidebar. You can select or deselect the repos
    in the chart legend without using the sidebar.</p>

  <h1>Caching</h1>
  <p>You may have noticed that this application caches some of your preferences set in the sidebar. View
    mode and best n are saved so you don't have to set them at every page refresh.</p>
  <p>Note that date range is not cached, because we want to default yesterday until one month before as range.</p>
